I was very skeptical at first because it seemed too good to be true but in reality it is that great! Ultimately there is no fee to transfer money in or out, and it allows you to invest any amount of money for any rate that you would wish. Normally if I invest any sum of money for around 10% interest it is then matched to a borrower and I am able to earn the interest. If you go too high on the rate you don t lose anything but you also will not be matched to make money on your investment. It also lets you choose for how long to invest. Let me know if you have questions and I would be happy to explain more. My recommendation would be to set up an account and deposit a small amount to test it for yourself to get the hang of it.</p>\n' +

It’s a similar business platform as Worthy Bonds (offering secured loans) where I invested too - but Worthy financial uses business assets as collateral for that loan, which is riskier as those assets can drop in value in times like these and are harder to liquidate if a business defaults on their loan. I like MyConstant approach to secured lending better and just moved more $ from my Worthy Bonds and Wealthfront accounts to MyConstant. I invested with Fundrise, Diversyfund and others that deliver good returns on investment - I’ve had 0 losses this past decade. I manage investments in my solo 401k too.</p>\n' +

      answer1: '\n' +
        '        <p>We’ve partnered with loan originators (companies that source borrowers) to offer you a greater choice of loans and better returns. A Loan Originator investment is a claim against a loan issued by our loan originator partner. Instead of buying the loan with all the rights and ownership of collateral (if any), you’re buying a right to receive payments from an existing loan. </p>\n' +
        '        <p>When you invest in a Loan Originator, the loan originator will guarantee to buy back the loan if the borrower defaults for 60 days. This repays your principal and earned profit up to and including the 60-day default period. </p>\n' +
        '        ',
      question2: 'How do Loan Originator loans work?',
      answer2: 'When you invest in a Loan Originator loan, you’re lending to a borrower through one of our loan origination partners. Depending on the loan originator, you might receive monthly repayments of the total due, monthly payments of the interest only, or everything at the end of the term – all of which you can withdraw when paid. If the borrower is 60 days late on any of these repayments, the loan originator will buy back the loan and return your principal and earned profit.',
      question3: 'What is a loan originator?',
      answer3: 'A loan originator is a partner that sources borrowers on our behalf. Some arrange loans for borrowers with collateral – such as cars or property – while others assess borrowers’ credit before issuing loans. In either case, our loan originators all come with a buy-back guarantee. That means if their borrowers default for 60 days or more, the loan originator will buy back the loan, returning your principal and earned profit.'

        '      <p>Flex is a deposit account that earns you 4% APY through automatic lending. When you deposit money into Flex, it goes into a liquidity pool managed by Compound Finance. Borrowers who’ve put up collateral can then secure loans from the pool in return for interest – and we pay that interest to you. Since your deposits go to a pool rather than individual borrowers, you can withdraw or deposit anytime, as often as you like, and without any fees.</p>\n' +

        '      ',
      question2: 'Why 4% APY?',
      answer2: 'Compound Finance uses a blockchain protocol that intelligently manages the lending pool. It also sets interest rates according to supply and demand. At the moment, the rate is fixed at 4% APY. In the future, it could be higher or lower depending on activity in Compound’s lending market.',
      question3: 'What is Compound Finance?',
      answer3: '\n' +
        '      <p>Compound Finance is a technology that intelligently manages a lending pool of over $150 million in assets (as of September 2019). Flex interfaces with this technology through an API that allows you to withdraw your deposits and earned interest at any time.</p>\n' +
        '      <p>Compound Finance lends in a similar way to banks: your deposits go in and are lent to borrowers in exchange for interest and collateral. But since Compound Finance is a technology, there is no need for branches or staff, so you enjoy a much better interest rate!</p>\n' +
